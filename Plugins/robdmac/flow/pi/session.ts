// REVISION: flow-v188-dry
//
// pi's settings for one session, apart from pi and the disk so the shared
// tests cover them: the defaults new sessions start with (flow.json, through
// `file`) and this session's own over them, kept in the session as `flow`
// entries (through `entries`). An older pi without session entries shares
// one set in flow.json, as before. flow.json is read afresh before anything
// compares with it (`refresh`): another pi session may have saved since.
// opencode keeps its settings the same way (opencode/tui.ts): its storage
// stands in for flow.json, and each session's record there for its entries.
// Pure (no Node imports).
