// REVISION: flow-v190-same-frame
//
// Flow for pi (badlogic/pi-mono), by Rob Macrae: the same ambient
// scenes as the Claude Code mod, in a widget above pi's editor. pi's events
// drive the same activity model, and the shared cell grid is drawn as 24-bit
// ANSI lines, stepped ~14 fps while busy and 8 fps when calm.
//
//   agent_start / agent_end       a turn lifts it, then it settles to idle
//   turn_start                    a model step; ctx.thinkingLevel sets the floor
//   message_update (deltas)       streamed text/thinking keeps it going
//   tool_call                     edits push it, commands spark, reads and other tools flicker
//   tool_result (isError, bash)   a failed command shows as smoke
//   session_compact               so does a compaction
//   ctx.getContextUsage()         a nearly-full context shows as blue
//
// `/flow` takes the same arguments
// as in Claude Code, day and night following the local clock unless pinned.
// As there, each session keeps its own settings: `/flow` changes the session
// it runs in, kept in the session itself (a `flow` entry, never sent to the
// model), so resuming or forking it brings them back. ~/.pi/agent/flow.json
// holds the defaults new sessions start with (read from the old vista.json
// or ascii-fire.json until that exists), read afresh before `/flow` compares
// with it (another pi session may have saved); `/flow save` writes it. An
// older pi without session entries keeps one set for every session, in that
// file, as before (session.ts). pi has no built-in subagents, so they never add to the scene here,
// and no side panes, so there is no spine, and `/flow pick` is a plain list (pi's own select)
// rather than thumbnails, its choice going the way `/flow <scene>` goes. Nor has it a player, so
// the soundscape (hooks/soundscape.ts, as in Claude Code and opencode) plays through afplay run in
// the background (node/player.ts, macOS; elsewhere `/flow sound` says there's none), once a turn has
// run or `/flow` has been used. pi tells an extension nothing of a wait on the person, so no chime.
// The one-time tips are Claude Code's and opencode's (the other scenes, then the sound), as a session
// starts or under a `/flow` reply, kept in flow.json (`tips`).
//
// In a terminal that draws kitty images (Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm, Warp), a
// scene that can draw itself at real pixels (earthrise) shows as a picture
// instead of its cells, taller than the band (picture.ts): flow.json's
// `"rows"` sets how tall (14 unless it says; never more than half the
// terminal), `"pictures": false` keeps the cells. A new size's picture is made
// a little each frame, the cells showing meanwhile, and what took long is
// kept in ~/.cache/flow for the next time. A scene with a taller view of its
// own (doom3d, through the marine's eyes) gets as many rows in cells.
