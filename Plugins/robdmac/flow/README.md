<img width="1200" height="384" alt="Flow's fire above the prompt: pilot lights at idle, climbing with each of Claude's tool calls, an inferno with three subagents, then back down when Claude is done" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0120cc-af23-44ec-9398-309cccd42764" />

Ambient scenes in your terminal that move with the work your coding agent is doing: a fire, fizzing bubbles, the surf, a ski run, two rockets, a hot-air balloon, a steam engine, a train through the countryside, Tesla's new Roadster out of town onto the freeway, a colony ship behind its shield, the Earth rising over the moon, and a space marine fighting through a 1993 techbase. They run above the prompt of Claude Code (in the terminal or the Claude desktop app), [opencode](https://opencode.ai) or [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), or in a tall pane beside Claude Code's transcript or in opencode's sidebar.

Each scene is drawn in 24-bit color from Unicode block, quadrant and braille characters, so several pixels share each terminal cell. In the Claude desktop app, which has no character grid to draw into, the same frames are drawn as images.

## Install

**Claude Code**, from inside a session:

```
/plugin marketplace add robdmac/flow
/plugin install flow-scenes@robdmac
/reload-plugins
```

Installed it before as `flow@robdmac`? The plugin is now `flow-scenes` (another plugin had the name `flow`). Run `/plugin uninstall flow@robdmac`, then install as above. The command is still `/flow`. Settings you'd saved in `/config` don't carry over: set them again, or set them with `/flow` and `/flow save`.

**Claude desktop**, in the Code tab: click **+** next to the prompt box, then **Plugins** → **Add plugin**, add the marketplace `robdmac/flow` and install **Flow** (`flow-scenes`). Manage it later from **+** → **Plugins** → **Manage plugins**. The desktop app and Claude Code share their plugins, so if you've installed Flow in the terminal it's already there. It runs in local sessions, not cloud ones.

**opencode** (2.0 or later), from your shell:

```
opencode plugin add github:robdmac/flow
```

**pi**, from your shell:

```
pi install git:github.com/robdmac/flow
```

Mods are an early-access Claude Code feature, and their API may change between releases (see Compatibility below).

### Not loading?

If `/flow` doesn't exist after installing, run `claude --debug` and look for a line about **hooks modules**:

- **"the rollout flag (tengu_plugin_hooks_modules) is off"**: mods from installed plugins are still being rolled out account by account, and yours doesn't have them yet. Update Claude Code (`claude update`), then turn them on yourself for one launch:

  ```
  CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1 claude
  ```

  (`claude -r` instead of `claude` resumes your last session.) To keep it on, add it to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

  ```json
  "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS": "1" }
  ```

  or export it in your shell profile.
- **"saved off by an earlier session"**: the flag was cached as off and hasn't refreshed yet. Start a new session, or use the setting above.
- **"not available on Bedrock/Vertex/third-party providers"** or **"with a custom ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL"**: mods only run against the Anthropic API, so Flow can't load there.
- **"until workspace trust is accepted"**: accept the trust prompt for the folder you started Claude in.

## The scenes

Every scene has a level from 0 (off) to 10 (as busy as it gets).

| Scene | At 1 | At 10 |
|---|---|---|
| `fire` | a low glow of embers | a roaring fire throwing sparks |
| `warp` | stars drifting past | hyperspace streaks |
| `avalon` | a colony ship among still stars, its habitat turning, now and then a rock burning up on its shield; every few minutes it passes a sun or flies through a nebula | stars streaking past, a rock flaring on the shield every few seconds |
| `balloon` | a hot-air balloon on the grass | up through the clouds to the edge of space |
| `engine` | a steampunk engine standing still | cogs, belts and pistons at full speed |
| `falcon`, `starship` | the rocket on its pad | climbing through the sky (2–7), separating at about 7, the upper stage in orbit (8–10); as it stages the screen splits, one side following the booster back down (falcon's lands on its legs, starship's is caught by the tower's arms), the other staying with the upper stage; brought home, falcon's Dragon capsule comes down under parachutes to a splashdown and the view slides back to the pad, and starship's Ship splashes down at sea and is carried back for the arms to lift on |
| `surf` | a glassy sea at dawn | big barrelling waves |
| `ski` | an easy run | a steep mogul run at speed |
| `bubbles` | a couple of lazy strings of bubbles | a rolling, fizzing boil |
| `train` | waiting at a red signal or a platform, its diesel idling (when the work starts the signal clears, the horn sounds and it pulls away; when it winds down the train pulls up again) | flat out past fields, villages, woods, rivers and stations, the poles and the line beside it a blur |
| `earthrise` | the Earth half risen over a cratered lunar horizon in long, low sunlight, turning once in about two minutes, under a still sky of a few breathing stars (after [earthrise](https://ascii.rest/earthrise/) by Shubham on [ascii.rest](https://github.com/bas3line/ascii), MIT: its notice is in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`) | the Earth risen clear of the horizon, spinning once every four seconds, its clouds running ahead; more stars, drifting past in layers, shooting stars, and now and then a comet trailing its tails |
| `doom` | a space marine in green armor plodding down a techbase corridor, pistol lowered, raising it now and then at a lone zombieman far down the hall | running and gunning with a plasma rifle, imps hurling fireballs, pinky demons charging, cacodemons floating in and barrels going up among them; the busier the work, the faster he moves, the faster he shoots and the heavier his gun (pistol, then shotgun from 3, chaingun from 6, plasma rifle from 9). In the tall pane it's his own view: down the corridor, doors rising as he nears them, his gun bobbing and the status bar with his ammo, health and face |
| `doom3d` | the same fight through his own eyes, everywhere: above the prompt too, in a taller band (14 rows where there's room) that sweeps wide down the corridor, his ammo in one corner, his face and health in the other | as `doom` |
| `roadster` | Tesla's new Roadster parked in a city parking lot beside the road (when the work starts it pulls out and away through town, quicker through 2 to 4, out through the suburbs on an artery road at 5 and 6, onto the freeway from 7, overtaking the traffic; when it winds down it slows back through them and pulls into the next lot) | flat out on the freeway, flipping over the cars in its lane on its jets (mostly the real one's sideways roll, now and then a somersault), a puff of vapour as it lifts |

**`earthrise`**: the Earth rising over the moon and turning faster as the work picks up, drawn here in pi as a halftone picture.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afe7e272-0a48-4668-b106-f2ae4732e977

**`doom`**: the marine side-on above the prompt, moving faster and changing to heavier guns as the work grows, imps, pinky demons and cacodemons coming down the hall at him.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9e4247-8f1f-42b6-b0d1-60598e6e4957

**`doom3d`**: the same fight through his own eyes, in pi's taller 14-row band, his ammo in one corner and his face and health in the other.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20196ad3-8dae-4e6e-99db-83fcd560b20e

`/flow pick` shows them all at once, each one live, to choose from with the arrow keys and Enter (in opencode and pi, a list).

Some scenes also answer to other names: `inferno` and `flame` (fire), `stars` (warp), `colony` and `interstellar` (avalon), `mechanism` (engine), `rocket` (falcon), `spaceship` (starship), `ocean` and `sea` (surf), `snow` (ski), `rail` and `railway` (train), `tesla` and `car` (roadster).

Balloon, falcon, starship, surf, ski, train and roadster also have a **night** version: stars, a moon, moonlit snow or water, the train's windows lit up, and the city's windows and street lamps with the Roadster's headlight on the road. By night, bubbles turns into a stout: pale tan bubbles rising through black. By default day and night follow your local clock (night is 19:00 to 7:00). `/flow day` or `/flow night` pins one.

## What moves it (auto mode)

| Your agent is… | The scene |
|---|---|
| idle | a low glow (or nothing, if you choose) |
| in a turn | rises to a level set by effort: `low` 2, default 3, `high` 4, `xhigh` 5, `max` 6 |
| working a while | one level more for every 30 s the turn has run (not counting time it waits on you: a permission prompt, a question, a plan to approve) |
| streaming an answer | keeps going (limited per second, so plain chat sits mid-range) |
| editing files | pushes higher, scaled by the lines written |
| running commands | sparks; a slow command keeps it ticking over |
| reading or searching, or using any other tool (an MCP server's too) | a small spark each |
| running subagents | busier with each one (with diminishing returns), and each one gets a companion of its own (see below); the rest add company: more stars, more lit windows, more streams of bubbles, more lights on the launch tower |
| hitting a failed command, or compacting | smoke for a moment: smoky flame tips, sooty steam, a grey sky, a wipeout, a rocket's plume sputtering grey, black smoke pouring from the train's diesel, the Roadster doing a burnout in its own tyre smoke under a grey haze, a pall of moondust over the lunar horizon, the techbase's lights going out under drifting smoke (and the marine's face bloodied) |
| near a full context (≥85%) | blue: a blue-white flame, a storm, dusk on the slopes, a blue gas flame, rain driving past the train and the Roadster, cold blue light over the moon, the techbase flooded with cold blue light |
| waiting on you: a permission to grant, its question, a plan to approve | settles to a calm 2 and holds, the whole scene turned a warm sepia that breathes slowly, about every 4 s: the fire banks to a bed of glowing coals, the stars stop, the colony ship comes to rest, the balloon hovers with its pilot light glowing, the engine runs down and lets off steam, a rocket holds its stage with amber lights up the tower, the surfer sits up waiting for a wave, the skier stops, the bubbles slow, the train draws up at a red signal or a platform, its headlight and the signal glowing with each breath, the Roadster pulls into the next lot and parks, its lights glowing, the Earth stops turning, the marine stops and lowers his gun as the monsters slink back into the dark, the computer panels glowing with each breath. With sound on, a soft chime as the wait begins |

The table is in Claude Code's terms; opencode and pi move it the same way from their own events (see *opencode* and *pi* below), except that pi tells Flow nothing of subagents or of a wait on you.

A plain answer sits around 5, edit-and-test loops reach about 8, and 10 takes several subagents editing in parallel, or a long turn: it climbs a level every 30 s it keeps going.

Waiting on you shows only while a dialog is actually up for you: a permission ask that auto mode's classifier settles by itself, or that a hook answers, isn't one. It ends when you answer (once the call is over, or as soon as a long command shows it's running). Like the tints, it shows in auto mode only, and only in the session that waits.

### Subagents, one by one

In Claude Code and opencode (pi has no subagents), in fire, surf, ski, balloon, falcon, starship, engine, train, avalon, doom, doom3d and roadster, each running subagent has a companion of its own, in its own colors or its own place, so you can tell at a glance which are busy, which have gone quiet or are waiting on you, and when each finishes:

| Scene | Arrives | Working | Quiet (nothing for 20 s) | Waiting on you (a permission dialog, its question) | Done |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fire` | the main fire narrows to make room and a small fire of its own kindles beside it, sparks catching (on alternate sides, a dark gap between each) | burns bright and lively, taller the busier the scene | dies down to low, glowing embers | its embers pulse a bright glow, quicker than the waiting fire's breath | burns out with a last puff of smoke and the gap closes, the main fire widening back (failed: snuffed out at once, in grey smoke) |
| `surf` | paddles in from the edge | paddles hard, or rides a following wave; on a big swell, rides the big wave with the surfer | sits up on its board, bobbing | sits up waving an arm | paddles off out of sight |
| `ski` | skis in from behind | carves S-turns, throwing spray | pulls over to the side, standing on its poles | waves a pole overhead | tucks and skis off ahead (failed: drops back) |
| `balloon` | a small balloon in stripes of its own rises into view from below | flies high, bobbing on blasts of its burner | burner out, sinks low | its envelope blinks | climbs away off the top (failed: sinks away below) |
| `falcon`, `starship` | a mini rocket (the same rocket, smaller) on a little launch site of its own beside the big one | flies the mission with the big one, a beat behind: lifts off, stages (its booster coming home beside the big one's: falcon's on its legs, starship's into its own tower's arms), keeps formation into orbit and comes home with it (Dragon under its own chutes; the Ship belly-first, carried home and stacked) | coasts, dropped back, a light blinking on its nose; on the ground it doesn't launch | an amber beacon flashes | fades as it pulls away ahead (failed: tumbles away in smoke) |
| `engine` | its lamps on the bed plate warm up | a light runs along its lamps | its lamps glow low | its lamps flash together | its lamps fade out (failed: fading red) |
| `train` | a short train of its own draws up alongside from out of sight | keeps pace on the next track, gaining and losing a little, headlamp lit | drops back a little, headlamp out | its cab flashes amber | falls back out of sight |
| `doom`, `doom3d` | another marine in co-op colors (indigo, brown, red, grey) runs in from behind (through his eyes, past him) and falls in with the squad | fires with him at whatever comes | drops back a little, gun lowered | a lamp blinks amber over its head | teleports out in a shimmer of green fog (failed: falls where it stood, and the squad walks on) |
| `avalon` | a probe launches from a bay on the ship's hull (the hatch glowing in its color) and flies up beside it | holds station by the ship on its own flickering drive | drive off, falls back along the ship, a running light blinking | an amber beacon flashes | turns about and burns away aft, off toward home (failed: drive dead, tumbles away dark) |
| `roadster` | a smaller Roadster in its own colour (red, blue, yellow, green, orange, purple) draws up in the far lane from behind | keeps pace, gaining and losing a little, lights on, flipping now and then on the freeway as the big one does (and over the traffic in its lane on the freeway) | drops back a little, lights off | its hazards blink | flips once and races off ahead (failed: falls back out of sight, trailing smoke) |

A scene has room for a few (the fire 4 to 6 small fires across the band, 1 or 2 in the spine, surf 5, ski 4, balloon 4, the rockets 3 mini rockets (one of them behind the big launch site in the spine; 1 in a spine narrower than 19 columns), the engine 6 lamp groups, the train up to 4 trains, avalon 4 probes, doom 4 marines (2 in a spine narrower than 14 columns), roadster up to 6 cars in a wide band (2 in the spine); fewer in the narrow spine or a narrow band: only as many as it shows whole); more wait for a place to come free. Warp and bubbles keep the plain company above: they're a stream of stars, a glass of anonymous bubbles, with nothing that stays put long enough to be someone. In the Claude desktop app, put the pointer over a companion to see its subagent's task, what it's doing and for how long; in opencode, click it and the same shows as a notice.

## The command

`/flow` changes things at once, in the session you run it in. Each session keeps its own scene and settings, so two sessions side by side can show different scenes, and resuming one (`claude --resume`, `claude --continue`, or opening it again in the Claude desktop app) brings its settings back. A `/clear` keeps the scene you had.

A new session starts on your defaults: the rows in `/config` (*Scene mode*, *Scene*, *Scene while idle*, *Manual level*, *Scene layout*, *Day or night*, *Sound*, *Sound volume*). `/flow save` makes the current session's settings your default, and `/flow reset` puts a session back on it. Changing a row in `/config` changes the default and the session you're in. A session already running keeps what it shows when the default changes elsewhere (another session's `/flow save`, say), and `/flow` on its own says when the session differs from your default, and how. `/flow save` saves exactly what the session shows. In opencode and pi there are no `/config` rows: the defaults are kept in opencode's storage for the plugin, or in pi's `~/.pi/agent/flow.json`, and `/flow save` writes them there (see *opencode* and *pi* below).

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/flow` | show the scene, mode, level and time of day |
| `/flow <scene>` | pick a scene by name or alias (`/flow surf`, `/flow sea`) |
| `/flow pick` | every scene at once, live, side by side in a pane: the arrows (or Tab) move, Enter (or the scene's number) picks it for this session, as `/flow <scene>` does, Esc closes; on desktop, click one. In opencode and pi, a list to choose from |
| `/flow next` | the next scene |
| `/flow day` / `night` | pin the time of day |
| `/flow clock` | day or night by your local clock (the default) |
| `/flow <scene> night` | a scene and a time of day at once |
| `/flow auto` | move with the agent's work (the default) |
| `/flow 1`–`10` / `off` | hold a fixed level, or switch it off |
| `/flow idle glow` / `dark` | in auto mode while idle: a low glow (the default), or nothing (the band gives its rows back) |
| `/flow sound` | toggle a soundscape for the scene, swelling with the work (macOS; off by default); `/flow sound on` / `off` to set it |
| `/flow sound 1`–`10` | the soundscape's volume, turning it on (7 is the default; each step below it 3 dB quieter); `/flow sound 0` turns it off. `/flow volume 1`–`10` does the same |
| `/flow band` / `spine` | a 5-row band above the prompt (the default; also `horizontal`, `bar` or `flat`), or a tall pane docked beside the transcript (also `portrait`, `vertical` or `side`); in opencode, the sidebar. pi has no panes, so there it's always the band |
| `/flow save` | make this session's settings your default, the one new sessions start with (it writes them to `/config`; in opencode, its storage; in pi, `flow.json`) |
| `/flow reset` | put this session back on your default |
| `/flow help` | list all of this |


## Sound

`/flow sound` (or *Sound* in `/config`) turns on a soundscape for each scene, and turns it off again, each one tuned against real recordings so it sounds like the thing itself: a campfire's sparse, bright crackle over the soft lick of its flames (and a bonfire's roar at the top), a beach's wash and its waves breaking now and then on a calm day, often on a rough one, a steam engine's chuffs in time with its crank, water bubbling and boiling, wind gusting round a balloon and its burner roaring, skis carving through snow, a train's diesel idling at the signal, and the roar of its wheels and the wind rising as it runs (matched to recordings made in a carriage and beside the line), a rocket's roar and crackle matched to NASA's launch recordings. The colony ship and the warp drive are science fiction, so theirs are designed: the hull's hum, the shield fizzing, and a low, muffled boom through the hull as each rock blows up on it; the drive's hum climbing with speed. So are the Earth rising over the moon's (no air on the moon, so no wind: only steady low tones, a deep drone and its fifth, a chord filling in with the work, a soft low tone for each shooting star and a long low chord for each comet) and the techbase's (its machinery humming, computer banks chirping, nukage bubbling, the fighting farther off; each gun its own shot as it fires, landing with its muzzle flash, monsters going down, barrels going up, fireballs thrown, doors grinding up, a squad marine teleporting out, the marine's footsteps), all generic: none of the game's own sounds. The Roadster's is designed too, after an electric car heard from inside: no engine, only the tyres' roar on the road and the motor's whine climbing with its speed, the wind on the freeway, and a city's distant traffic while it's parked; its jets' deep roar is matched to film of the real car's jump.

The background is long takes that blend one into the next at random moments, so nothing comes round on a beat, and a fresh one crossfades in whenever the level or the scene changes (a rocket on the pad, climbing, in orbit, coming home). On top of it you hear what happens on screen, as it happens: bubbles bursting, rocks blowing up on the shield, sparks, a wave breaking, each ski turn, the hammer, the train's horn as it pulls away and before each level crossing, the Roadster's jets as it lifts into a flip and its tyres taking hold as it lands, and the rockets' ignition, staging, the booster's sonic boom, the catch, parachutes and splashdown. Every scene follows the same loudness from level 1 (quiet) to 10.

`/flow sound 1` to `10` turns it on at that volume in the session you run it in (*Sound volume* in `/config` is the volume new sessions start with, and `/flow save` makes this session's it). 7, the default, is the loudness the scenes were tuned to; each step below it is 3 dB quieter, so 1 is 18 dB down. Above 7 there's little room left: the loudest sounds already play near full scale, and any louder they'd distort. So 8, 9 and 10 lift the quieter sounds by up to 2, 4 and 6 dB, the louder ones by less and the loudest not at all, and a busier moment still sounds busier than a calm one. `/flow sound 0` turns it off, and `/flow sound` turns it back on at the volume it had.

When your agent starts waiting on you (a permission, its question, a plan to approve; in Claude Code and opencode, as pi doesn't say when it waits), a soft chime: two struck tubes rising a fourth, about as loud as a scene at 6. Once a wait, and not for one right behind another (within 20 s): you're there already. It's part of the soundscape, so it follows the session's sound setting: `/flow sound` turns it on and off with the rest. For an alert without the ambience, there's Claude Code's own notification setting in `/config` (opencode has its own notifications too).

It plays only while the scene is on screen, and stops with the session. Claude Code plays the clips with `afplay`, and in opencode and pi Flow runs `afplay` itself, so it's macOS only; elsewhere the setting does nothing. It's set per session like everything else, so you can have it on in one session and not another, or quieter in one; several sessions with it on each play their own.

## Turning it off

Run `/flow off`, or `/flow idle dark` to stay in auto mode but show nothing while idle. Either applies to the session you run it in; follow it with `/flow save` to make it the default for new sessions too. You can also disable the plugin (in opencode, `opencode plugin remove github:robdmac/flow`; in pi, `pi remove git:github.com/robdmac/flow`). In Claude Code, Flow draws in the terminal and in the Claude desktop app; not in VS Code or on mobile.

## pi

The same scenes run as a pi extension (`pi/index.ts`): a widget above pi's editor, drawn as 24-bit ANSI lines. It shares the scenes, the activity model, the soundscapes and the `/flow` command with the Claude Code version. pi has no side panes, so there is no spine there, and no built-in subagents (so no companions). pi's events drive it:

| pi event | The scene |
|---|---|
| `agent_start` / `agent_end` | a turn lifts it (a level more for every 30 s it runs), then it settles to idle |
| `turn_start` | rises to the floor for `ctx.thinkingLevel` (`minimal`/`low` 2 … `max` 6) |
| `message_update` deltas | streamed text and thinking keep it going |
| `tool_call` | `write`/`edit` push it by lines written, `bash` sparks, reads and other tools flicker |
| `tool_result` with `isError` | a failed command shows as smoke |
| `session_compact` | so does a compaction |
| `ctx.getContextUsage()` | a nearly-full context shows as blue |

In a terminal that draws images (Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm, Warp; not under tmux), `earthrise` shows in pi as a picture at the terminal's own pixels rather than in characters, drawn as the original is: a halftone of dots sized by brightness in the original's 38 colours, 14 rows tall (never more than half the terminal). Set `"rows"` in `~/.pi/agent/flow.json` for another height, or `"pictures": false` to keep the characters. The first time pi opens at a new width the characters show for a moment while the picture's ground is made. Flow keeps the ground of the last few sizes in `~/.cache/flow`, so the picture shows at once the next time. The other scenes stay in characters.

`doom3d` takes the same height in characters (`"rows"` sets it too), for the view through the marine's eyes. In Claude Code its band is as tall as the prompt leaves room for, up to 14 rows.

pi tells an extension nothing of a wait on you, so there the scenes never show one (nor chime). It has no player for an extension's sounds either, so for the soundscape Flow runs `afplay` (macOS) in the background itself, as in opencode, once a turn has run or `/flow` has been used: `/flow sound` turns it on. The one-time tips are the same as in Claude Code and opencode, kept in `flow.json`.

As in Claude Code, each session keeps its own settings, kept in the session itself (an entry the model never sees), so resuming or forking it brings them back. `~/.pi/agent/flow.json` holds the defaults new sessions start with; `/flow save` writes it. To try it without installing: `pi --extension ./pi/index.ts`.

## opencode

The same scenes run as an opencode terminal UI plugin (`opencode/tui.ts`, opencode 2.0 or later): above the prompt of the session on screen, or with `/flow spine` in its sidebar. They share the scenes, the activity model, the soundscapes and the `/flow` command with the Claude Code version; `/flow pick` is opencode's own list, `/flow help` a dialog. Click a subagent's companion to see what it's doing: its task, whether it's working, quiet, waiting on you or done, and how long it's run. The one-time tips are the same as in Claude Code: the other scenes, then the sound, each once, as a session first shows or under a `/flow` reply. opencode's events drive it:

| opencode event | The scene |
|---|---|
| `session.execution.started` / ended | a turn lifts it (a level more for every 30 s it runs), then it settles to idle; a turn that fails shows as smoke |
| `session.step.started`, text and reasoning deltas | each model step, and streamed text and thinking, keep it going; the model's variant sets the floor (`low` 2 … `max` 6) |
| `session.tool.called` | `write`/`edit`/`apply_patch` push it by lines written, `shell` sparks, reads and other tools flicker |
| `session.tool.success`, `.failed` | a command that exits non-zero shows as smoke |
| `session.created` with a parent | a subagent: a companion of its own, there till its run ends (done well, or not) |
| `permission.asked`, `form.created` | a permission or a question put to you: the scene settles and breathes till it's answered |
| `session.compaction.ended` | smoke, as for a compaction in Claude Code |
| `session.usage.updated` | a context nearly full (the last step's tokens over the model's limit) shows as blue |

Each session keeps its own settings, kept in Flow's own opencode storage under the session's id (the 100 used most recently), so reopening it brings them back; `/flow save` makes them the defaults new sessions start with, for every opencode on the machine. Options set for the plugin in `cli.json` (`{ "package": "github:robdmac/flow", "options": { "style": "surf" } }`) are defaults too, under what `/flow save` keeps. opencode has no player for a plugin's own sounds, so for the soundscape Flow runs `afplay` (macOS) in the background itself, one per clip, stopped with the scene or opencode.

## What Flow does on your machine

**Privacy:** Flow collects nothing. It has no servers, sends no data anywhere, and keeps what little it stores (below) on your machine: in Claude Code's or opencode's own storage for the plugin, or in pi under `~/.pi/agent/flow.json` and `~/.cache/flow`.

**Network:** none. Flow sends nothing anywhere and contacts no hosts. Everything it draws and plays is computed locally from the plugin's own files. The one call that takes anything out of the plugin is `$.audio.play`, which hands one of the plugin's own clips from `sounds/` (and a volume) to the local audio player, `afplay`: nothing Flow reads (settings, the conversation, your files) goes into it, and it reaches no address. In opencode and pi, which have no such call, Flow starts `/usr/bin/afplay` itself for each clip (macOS only, and only with the sound on): its arguments are a volume and the path of one of the plugin's own clips, or of a short sound it made (written to a file of its own in the system's temporary folder, and deleted once played). It runs nothing else.

**Your settings:** Flow writes its own `/config` rows (the `flow-scenes` plugin's options: scene, mode, sound and the rest) only when you run `/flow save`, which writes the settings your session shows as the defaults for new sessions. It reads them (`$.config.list()`) to start each session on your defaults.

In Claude Code it writes no other settings, no files and no environment variables. (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS`, under *Not loading?*, is a variable you set yourself, if you need it.)

**What it keeps:** in Claude Code's per-plugin store, each session's own `/flow` settings (the 100 most recently used sessions, none unused for 60 days) and which one-time tips you've seen. In the session's own plugin state, the balloon's altitude and whether someone has been at the session. In opencode, each session's own `/flow` settings (the 100 most recently used), the defaults `/flow save` keeps and which one-time tips you've seen, in opencode's storage for the plugin. In pi, a session's settings go in the session as an entry the model never sees, and `~/.pi/agent/flow.json` holds the defaults `/flow save` writes, which one-time tips you've seen and the pi version a too-old warning was given for (Claude Code and opencode keep those last two in their stores too); `~/.cache/flow` keeps earthrise's picture for the last few sizes. With the sound on in opencode or pi, a short sound Flow makes is written to the system's temporary folder while it plays, then deleted.

**Sound:** off unless you turn it on. Claude Code plays the plugin's own clips (`sounds/`) through `afplay`, only after someone has typed or run a turn in the session; in opencode and pi, Flow plays them through `afplay` itself, once a turn has run or `/flow` has been used (in opencode, in the session on screen).

**What its hooks see, and what they decide:** nothing. Every hook passes the event on unchanged (the one Flow answers is its own `/flow` command); Flow never blocks, allows, rewrites or answers a tool call, a permission, a prompt or a setting. It only watches, to set how busy the scene looks:

| Hook | What Flow reads | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `tool.call` | the tool's name, the number of lines an edit or write adds (not their text), whether a `Bash` command failed; its arguments, held only while it runs (see below) | how busy the scene is; a failed command shows as smoke |
| `classic.PermissionRequest` | that a permission dialog is about to show: its tool's name and input, which subagent. The input is only compared with the arguments of the calls running, to tell which call the dialog is for, and kept nowhere | the scene settles and breathes while Claude waits on you, until that call is answered |
| `turn.start`, `turn.complete`, `turn.step` | when a turn or a subagent's run starts and ends; how much text is streamed (its length only) | the level, and each subagent's companion |
| `session.compact`, `session.measure` | that a compaction happened; how full the context is | smoke; blue when it's nearly full |
| `config.set` | a change to one of Flow's own `/config` rows | applies it to the session at once |
| `prompt.edit` | that a key was pressed in the prompt (not what) | someone is there, so sound may play |
| `command.run` | `/flow` and its arguments (only its own command: it answers `/flow`, and sees no other) | the command |
| `session.start`, `session.end`, `ui.*` | the session's id; the panes it draws | its settings; the band, the spine and `/flow pick` |

It also lists the session's running subagents (`$.agent.list()`: their state, task and type) to give each one a companion and a hover card.

In opencode, Flow is a terminal UI plugin only: nothing of it runs in opencode's server, and it changes nothing it hears. It reads opencode's events for the session on screen and its subagents, as in the table under *opencode*: tool names, the lines an edit writes (counted, not kept), a command's exit code, how much text streams (its length), that a permission or question is up and when it's answered, token counts. It draws in two places in opencode's screen (above the prompt, and the sidebar) and adds the `/flow` command.

## Cost

Flow repaints about 14 times a second while busy and 8 times when calm. It skips unchanged frames and doesn't repaint at all while off screen. In the desktop app it redraws at most 10 times a second. The heaviest scene takes under 2 ms per frame.

## Compatibility

Built against Claude Code 2.1.289, opencode 2.0.29 and pi 1.0.0, the oldest of each it's known to work on. On an older one Flow still runs, but says so once (a notice when a session starts, once for each version), since a scene may misbehave there. Mods (function-hook plugins) are early access: the API may change between Claude Code releases, so a newer release can break flow until it's updated. opencode's plugin API for its terminal UI is new with opencode 2, and may change between its releases too.

## Development

```sh
claude --plugin-dir .   # load it, with hot reload (loading writes its types to .claude-plugin/types/)
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin test .
npm install && npm run typecheck
```

CI ([ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs these and `npm run check` on every pull request and push to main.

### Add your own scene

```sh
npm install
npm run new-scene -- aurora --blurb "curtains of light that ripple faster with the work" --night
npm run preview -- aurora    # see it here at levels 1, 5 and 10, as a band and a spine, with each tint and waiting
claude --plugin-dir .        # then /flow aurora
npm run check                # colour pairs and timing, before you open a pull request
```

`new-scene` writes `hooks/aurora.ts`: a scene that already moves with the level, shows the tints, breathes while Claude waits on you and (with `--night`) has a night. Edit its `paint()`: it gets a grid of pixels (2 × 2 a terminal cell) and the dials (the level, eased; the frame count; night; the tint; how far into a wait on you; whether it's the tall spine). [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) has the rules a scene keeps to.

To try the opencode version from a checkout, put a one-line `tui.ts` in a project's `.opencode/plugins/flow/`: `export { default } from '/path/to/flow/opencode/tui.ts'`, then run `opencode` in that project.

Every hook file carries a `// REVISION:` marker. On startup the mod writes the loaded revision, the local time and the UTC offset to the debug log (`claude --debug`).
