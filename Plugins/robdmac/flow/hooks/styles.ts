// REVISION: flow-v192-roadster
//
// The scenes, all driven by the same dials (strength 0..10, coverage boost,
// the agents one by one, tint, night, waiting): SCENES, the one list of them (each scene file exports its
// SceneDef; add yours there), and the fire itself (`Ember`, the `fire` scene): the ░▒▓█
// Doom-style automaton of fire.ts for its shape, glyphs and crisp flicker,
// colored half its 256-color ramp, half a smooth truecolor black-body eased
// over time, with sparks breaking off the tips and cooling into smoke.
// Each running subagent gets a small fire of its own beside it (crew.ts): the
// main fire narrows to make room and they kindle on either side, a dark gap
// between each, all burning in the one automaton.
// Everything off the flames is transparent: no backgrounds. While Claude
// waits on the person the fire banks: low flames over a bed of coals along
// the bottom, glowing and fading with each slow breath (waiting.ts).
