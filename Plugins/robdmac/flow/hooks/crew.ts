// REVISION: flow-v188-dry
//
// A scene's companions: one for each running subagent (the `agents` dial,
// agents.ts), so a glance tells you which are busy, which have gone quiet or
// wait on you, and when one finishes. A companion arrives when its agent
// starts (`here` easing 0 → 1), works while its agent does (`busy` 1), rests
// while it's quiet or waiting (`busy` 0; `waiting` too when it waits on the
// person), and leaves when it's done (`here` easing back to 0), then frees
// its place for the next. Each keeps one `slot` (its lane, its colors) the
// whole time it's on screen. Only slots the layout can show are given (`room`:
// a narrow spine fits fewer than the band); agents past it wait for one to
// come free, and a layout with less room sends those it can't show back to
// wait (they come in again, easing, as room comes). A scene keeps a Crew,
// sets `room` for its layout, calls `update` once a frame and draws its
// `mates` however it likes, noting where each is (`mark`) for desktop's hover
// cards; `resting`, `beckon`, `finished`, `failed` and `easeTo` say what every
// scene's companions do alike. An adapter that only counts subagents
// (`coverageBoost`, no list) still gets companions: anonymous ones, that
// many, working.
// Pure: no `$`.
