// REVISION: flow-v189-pure-grid
//
// Two launch sites in the sky world (sky.ts): a Falcon 9 and a Starship, each
// beside a lattice launch tower (Starship's with two catch arms). The level is the
// rocket's target altitude. At 1 it stands on the pad, fuelled, venting
// white vapour. When the level rises it ignites, holds a beat while steam
// billows off the pad, then lifts off: slowly, then faster, the plume
// (white-hot core, orange, fading red) trailing a contrail that falls away
// below as the clouds go by, until at 10 it hangs among the stars over
// Earth's rim. High in the climb (about level 7) the stack separates: the
// spent booster falls away and the upper stage flies on, on one narrower
// engine. Only the booster comes home: when the level falls back the upper
// stage goes on to orbit and the booster comes down, grid fins out,
// coasting, then lights a landing burn. Once the falling booster has left
// the frame the screen splits (side by side in the band, top and bottom in
// a tall pane): the booster's side follows it back down through the sky a
// layer a second, then slides away; the other stays with the upper stage,
// whatever the level. Falcon's booster puts its legs out only for its
// landing burn, on a landing zone out of sight of the pad.
// Falcon carries Dragon: in orbit it parts from the second stage (which
// drifts off, to burn up). Brought home, Dragon drops its trunk, comes in
// glowing, opens two drogues then four striped mains and splashes down at
// sea; a moment later the camera slides back along the coast to the pad,
// reset for the next flight. Starship's booster is caught by the tower's
// arms in mid-air and lowered onto the mount. Brought home, the Ship comes
// in belly-first, tiles glowing, flips upright for its landing burn and
// splashes down, is carried in by barge and transporter to beside the
// waiting booster, and the arms reach over, lift it, swing it across and
// lower it on. Then the stack goes back to venting. A mission only climbs:
// a dip in the work holds the level, and only back at 1 does it come home,
// a level a second, all the way.
//
// Everything is drawn into a pixel layer at quadrant resolution (two pixels
// per cell across, two down) and composited over the sky: each cell keeps
// the two colors that best fit its four pixels, so the rocket, the tower's
// lattice and the plume are twice as fine as the grid, and soft things
// (vapour, steam, the plume's tail) blend into whatever sky is behind them.
//
// Each running subagent (crew.ts) gets a mini rocket of its own: the same
// rocket, smaller (its sprites the big one's pixel art with rows and columns
// dropped), on a little launch site beside the big one, drawn behind it. A
// mini rocket is a LaunchSite like the big one, running the same flight,
// but hosted: it paints into the host's pixel layer, sees through its camera
// and lives in its world (folded and unfolded with it). It flies the host's
// level a few frames late, so it ignites, lifts off, stages, comes home and
// is stacked again as the big one does, never in step: its booster comes
// back on the split screen beside the big one's (Falcon's onto its legs on
// a landing zone of its own, Starship's into its own tower's arms), and its
// upper stage keeps formation with the big one's, in orbit too, and comes
// home with it (Dragon under its own chutes; the Ship belly-first, flipping
// to land, carried home and stacked). A working agent's rocket keeps
// station; a quiet one's coasts, dropped back, a light blinking on its nose
// (an amber beacon, shining through the waiting sepia, while it waits on
// you), and on the ground it doesn't launch. Arriving, its site eases in (in
// flight it climbs up into formation); done, it fades as it goes, in flight
// pulling away ahead (failed: falling away, tumbling, in smoke).
//
// Dials: running subagents add vapour and more tower lights; a failed
// command makes the engines sputter a grey, smoky plume (on the pad the
// vents fume grey and the tower lights burn low; in orbit it coughs smoke
// back along its track); a nearly-full context burns a blue methane-ish
// plume, turns the tower's lights blue all the way up, and in orbit fires
// blue-white thruster puffs off the nose. Either tint keeps a thin burn
// going in orbit, where the engines would otherwise coast dark. While Claude
// waits on the person the mission holds its stage (the level drops only to
// 2, and a dip holds), amber lights glow up the tower with each slow breath
// and the whole view breathes in sepia (waiting.ts).
