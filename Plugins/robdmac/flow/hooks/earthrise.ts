// REVISION: flow-v191-tidy

// Earthrise (the `earthrise` scene): the Earth coming up over a cratered
// lunar horizon in long, low sunlight, after "earthrise" by Shubham on
// ascii.rest (https://ascii.rest/earthrise/; Copyright (c) 2026 bas3line, MIT,
// its notice in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES). The level is how high the
// Earth stands and how fast it turns: at 1 it is half behind the horizon,
// turning once in about two minutes; at 10 it stands clear of the horizon,
// turning every few seconds, its clouds running a little ahead. It climbs
// and sinks over several seconds as the work picks up or winds down.
//
// The dark sky comes alive with the work: at 1 a few stars hold still and
// breathe; as the level rises more of them come out, the field drifts past
// in three layers (the near ones faster), more of them twinkle, shooting
// stars streak across, and from about 3 up a comet now and then drifts
// through, its tails streaming away from the sun.
//
// Where the terminal draws images (pi in Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm), it is
// also drawn as a picture (`picture`), the original's way: every cell of a
// square grid a halftone dot (none, ·, • or ●) sized by its brightness,
// ordered-dithered, in the nearest of the original's 38 colours. The
// ground is built a few columns a frame for each new size, the sky left
// clear.
//
// The ground is the original's heightfield of craters and boulders, seen
// from a camera standing on it and marched column by column, with real
// shadows marched toward the sun. It is built once a size (`resize`); each
// frame only the Earth (a lit globe with its own map of land, sea, ice and
// cloud, spun) and the stars are drawn again. Everything is laid out in the
// original's own coordinates (its 200 × 100 cells, square) and sampled into
// the pixel layer: the band sees a wide strip across the horizon (squeezed
// to fit a wide terminal), the spine a tall view, the Earth high in it.
//
// Smoke raises a grey pall of moondust over the horizon and greys
// everything; a full context turns the light cold and blue. While Claude
// waits on the person the Earth holds where it stands and stops turning
// (PixelScene breathes the frame in sepia; a picture takes the same tone).
//
// Heard (sound.ts): no air on the moon, so no wind or noise, only steady low
// tones in one key: a deep drone and its fifth, a chord filling in with the
// work; each shooting star a soft low tone, each comet a long low chord.
