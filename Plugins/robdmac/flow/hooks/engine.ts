// REVISION: flow-v189-pure-grid
//
// Engine (the `engine` style): a Victorian steam engine room on the same dials
// as the fire; the level is how hard it is being driven. At 1 it stands cold,
// a dim glow in the firebox and the odd wisp from the safety valve. As the
// level climbs, everything turns together off one crank angle (its speed
// eases toward each level's target, so the room spins up and runs down
// smoothly): the flywheel, the piston in its cut-away cylinder, the
// connecting rod and valve gear, the governor's flying balls, a line shaft
// with its pulleys and leather belts, trains of meshing cogs (each turning at
// its gear ratio, neighbours in opposite directions), a cam-driven trip
// hammer, a rocking beam pump, a grindstone throwing sparks, gauges, brick
// smokestacks. By 10 spokes and teeth blur, belts race, steam pours and
// sparks fly.
//
// The band lays it out sideways: the mill engine on the left, then a line
// shaft along the top driving a run of machinery modules chosen to fill the
// width. A tall spine stacks a vertical engine (flywheel at the foot,
// cylinder, boiler, chimney) with belts running up both sides to a line shaft
// overhead, gear trains beside the crosshead, and steam room at the top.
//
// Drawing happens on two sub-cell canvases: solid parts on a quadrant grid
// (2×2 a cell, rendered as quadrant blocks with a fg and bg color) and the
// moving parts on a braille dot grid (2×4 a cell, the same x resolution).
// Steam is a density field at dot resolution, drawn as dithered braille.
// Subagents thicken the steam (the coverage boost), and each lights a group
// of lamps of its own along the bed plate (crew.ts): they warm up as its agent
// starts, a light runs along them while it works, they glow low while it's
// quiet and flash together while it waits on you, and fade out when it's done
// (red, if it failed). Smoke makes the engine sputter, the chimney pour sooty
// black smoke (even cold) and the lamps burn low; a nearly-full context turns the
// firebox to a blue gas flame, the steam and gauges blue-white, and blinks a
// blue lamp on the boiler. While Claude waits on the person the engine runs
// down to a stop with steam up, the safety valve lifting with each slow
// breath, the whole room breathing in sepia (waiting.ts).
