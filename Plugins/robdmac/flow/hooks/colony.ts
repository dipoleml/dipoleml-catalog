// REVISION: flow-v170-dry-scenes
//
// A colony ship on the same dials as the fire: the level is its speed. A
// long ship like the Avalon holds steady (nose to the right in the band,
// nose up in a tall spine) while three layers of stars drift past behind
// it: an engine block at the stern, a bare truss spine, and three habitat
// blades twisted round that spine, turning (the helix slides along the ship
// and each blade brightens as it swings to face us, its windows showing,
// and darkens as it passes behind). Ahead of the bow a deflector shield
// arcs across the lane, the ship small behind it. Now and then a rock drifts
// in from ahead, strikes the shield and burns up: an orange-white flash
// where it hits, embers sprayed off the shield that cool and fade, and a
// ripple of light running along it.
//
// At 1 the stars barely move, a slow rock comes by once in a long while and
// the shield is faint. As the level climbs the stars stretch into streaks
// and the rocks come more often and faster; by 10 the stars blur past, the
// plume burns long and a rock strikes every few seconds. Subagents light more of the
// habitat windows, and each one flies a probe of its own (below); smoke
// dims the engine to gray, coughs puffs out behind it, leaves the shield
// flickering weakly and makes the probes' drives misfire gray; a
// nearly-full context turns the shield a hard-glowing cyan and the stars a
// deep blue. While Claude waits on the person the ship comes to a stop among
// still stars, breathing in sepia (waiting.ts).
//
// The voyage goes on behind it all: long stretches of open stars (two to
// five minutes), then a passage of two to four minutes, eased in and out, drawn
// from the scene's seed. Sometimes a sun drifts by (a yellow, an orange or a
// red one: a glowing disc as big as the band is tall, its corona fading out,
// no stars through it), warming the ship's hull as it passes near; sometimes
// a nebula fills the whole background, soft clouds shading between two
// colors and drifting past. Their light is held to a few steps, so the frame
// stays well within the Raster's pairs. Smoke turns the backdrop a gray
// haze and a full context a deep blue, as strong as its light (the dark
// between the clouds stays dark); stopped for the person, the passage holds
// where it is, in sepia.
//
// Each subagent's probe is a little craft like the Hail Mary's Beetles, in its
// own hull color with its own bright drive (crew.ts; four at most, two up by
// the bow and two along the habitat, on the band's top and bottom rows or
// either side of the spine): it's launched from a bay at the habitat's aft
// hub (the hatch glowing in its drive's color as it slides out sideways from
// behind the hull, then flies up to its station), holds station beside the
// ship on a flickering burn while its agent works, cuts
// its drive and falls back along the ship while it's quiet (a running light
// blinking slowly; an amber beacon flashing, a light through the waiting
// sepia, while it waits on you), and when its agent is done turns about and
// burns away aft, off toward home; if it failed, its drive goes dead and it
// tumbles away dark, out of the lane.
//
// Everything is placed in a flight frame (a = along the direction of
// travel, c = across it, both in braille dots: square, two a cell across and
// four down) and mapped onto the screen only when drawn, so the band and the
// spine share every rule. The hull is a pixel layer folded into quadrant
// glyphs; the bare spine, the shield, rocks and embers are braille dots.
