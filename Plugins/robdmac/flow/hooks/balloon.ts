// REVISION: flow-v170-dry-scenes
//
// A hot-air balloon in the sky world (sky.ts): the level is its target
// altitude. At 1 it sits on the grass among trees and houses; it climbs past
// birds and the layered clouds into a thinning sky; at 10 it floats in space
// among stars, Earth's blue rim below. It drifts side to side in the wind,
// its burner flickers while it climbs, a failed command grays the burner's
// flame and leaves a trail of sooty smoke drifting off behind it, and a
// nearly-full context turns the stripes blue. While Claude waits on the person
// it hovers where it is, its burner off but for the pilot glowing with each
// slow breath (sky.ts, waiting.ts).
//
// Each subagent flies a companion: a miniature of the balloon (the same
// parts: a striped envelope, its throat and burner, the basket on its lines),
// striped in its own pair of colors (crew.ts). The big one is drawn in cells,
// the small ones in quadrant pixels so they can bob by half a cell; both are
// painted part by part through one palette (`partColor`). It rises into view
// from below when its agent starts, flies high with its burner flickering
// while the agent works, lets the burner go out and sinks low while it's
// quiet (its envelope blinking while it waits on you, a light that shines
// through the wait's sepia), and when the agent is done climbs away off the
// top (or, if it failed, sinks away below). Each flies its own way: its own
// cruising height, a slow random drift of its own, and its own buoyancy (how
// fast it climbs on its burner, how slowly it sinks as it cools), so no two
// move in step.
