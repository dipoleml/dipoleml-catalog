// REVISION: flow-v173-directory
//
// How busy the agent is: the work → scene mapping for `/flow auto`. Events
// add "heat" (the metaphor from when the only scene was a fire), the heat
// cools every frame, and `strength()` turns it into the scene's 0..=10 dial
// (a fire's height, the swell, the balloon's altitude, ...), and a turn that
// keeps going climbs a level every 30 s besides (its clock stopped while it
// waits on the person: a permission, a question, a plan). While one of those
// is put to the person (a dialog is up for them, in any loop) the level
// settles to a calm 2 and the scenes show it (`isAwaitingPerson`, waiting.ts).
// It keeps what every loop waits on (waits.ts, one tracker for the main loop
// and the subagents), says which tint shows: smoke after a failure or a
// compaction, blue when the context is nearly full, and keeps the roster of
// subagents, each on its own (agents.ts: the scenes' companions). Pure: no
// `$`, so it is unit-tested directly.
//
// Calibrated so the range reads as work, not chatter (see the calibration
// tests): a streamed answer sits mid-range, reads and any other tool (an MCP
// server's) spark a little, edits and commands flare above it, a few
// subagents push it high, and 10 takes parallel work plus edits.
