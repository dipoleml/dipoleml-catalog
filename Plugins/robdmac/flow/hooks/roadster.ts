// REVISION: flow-v192-roadster
//
// Roadster (the `roadster` scene): Tesla's new Roadster, side-on, driving
// left to right with the camera keeping pace, the level its speed and where
// it's got to. At 1 it's parked in a city parking lot beside the road. When
// the work starts it pulls out onto the town's streets (shops, street lamps,
// traffic lights), picking up speed through 2 to 4; at 5 and 6 it's out
// through the suburbs on a faster artery road (houses, trees, power poles);
// 7 to 9 it's on the freeway (a concrete barrier, light poles, gantry signs,
// traffic to overtake), and at 10 it flips: jet-assisted jumps over the cars
// ahead, mostly rolling sideways about its length as the real one does, now
// and then a somersault, a puff of vapour off its jets as it lifts. When the work winds
// down it slows back through them and pulls into the next lot. Each part of
// the world comes in from the right as the level says, so the way out and
// the way back are never the same.
//
// Each subagent is a smaller Roadster of its own in its own colour
// (crew.ts), in the far lane: it draws up from behind when its agent starts,
// keeps pace while the agent works (gaining and losing a little, its lights
// on, flipping now and then on the freeway as the big one does), drops
// back with its lights off while the agent is quiet (its hazards blinking while it waits on you),
// and when the agent is done flips once and races off ahead, or, failed,
// falls back out of sight trailing smoke. Every one of them jumps the
// traffic in its lane on the freeway.
//
// A failed command (or a compaction) is a burnout: tyre smoke pours off the
// back wheels under a grey overcast. A nearly-full context brings a storm,
// rain driving past, the headlights on. By night the windows are lit, the
// street lamps pool on the pavement and the headlights light the road ahead.
// While Claude waits on the person it pulls into the next lot and stands
// there, its lights shining through the sepia.
//
// The band and the spine both look at it side-on: the spine's height goes
// to the sky (the city's towers rise into it, the flips go higher) and to a
// pavement on the near side, where its parking lot is (the band's is across
// the road). Painted as pixels (2 × 2 a cell, each pixel twice as tall as it
// is wide) by PixelScene, which eases the level and the night, folds the
// pixels into glyphs and blanks it all at level 0.
