// The calls waiting on the person, in every loop: the main one's and each
// subagent's, one tracker for both (Activity owns it; the Roster asks it which
// subagents wait). A permission waits once its dialog shows (`prompted`, from
// `classic.PermissionRequest`: auto mode's classifier settles most asks alone,
// and that's no wait), matched to the loop's running call of that tool (each
// call noted as it starts, `called`); Claude's question or a plan to approve
// waits from the start. A wait ends when its call ends (`tool.call`'s finally:
// the permission prompt runs beneath it, so a refusal ends there too) or shows
// it's running (its progress pill, which carries only the call's id: the call
// noted says which tool and loop). Matched to its own call (by input when the loop
// runs several of the tool), a dialog ends with that call alone; one with no call noted
// waits under its tool's name and loop until a call of that tool in that loop ends. Pure: no `$`, unit-tested directly.
