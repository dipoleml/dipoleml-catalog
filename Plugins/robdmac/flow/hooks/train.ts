// REVISION: flow-v170-dry-scenes
//
// Train (the `train` scene): a passenger train through the countryside on
// the same dials as the fire; the level is its speed. At 1 it waits at a red
// signal (or alongside a station's platform), its diesel idling. When the
// work starts the signal clears, the horn sounds and it pulls away, and the
// harder the work the faster it runs: fields, villages, woods, rivers and
// stations stream past at their depths' paces, the telegraph poles flick by,
// and at the top it's a dash, everything near the line a blur. When the work
// winds down it slows, and pulls up at the next red signal or platform.
//
// Each subagent runs alongside on the next track, a short train of its own in
// its own livery (crew.ts): it draws up from behind, out of sight, when its
// agent starts, keeps pace while the agent works (gaining and losing a
// little, its headlamp lit), drops back a little with its headlamp out while
// the agent is quiet (its cab flashing amber while it waits on you), and
// falls back out of sight when the agent is done. Only as many as the view
// shows whole run alongside; the rest wait for a place. A failed command (or a
// compaction) sends black smoke pouring from the diesel's exhaust under a
// grey sky; a nearly-full context brings a storm, rain driving past, the
// lights on. By night the carriages' windows glow, the headlight lights the
// line ahead, and the villages, stations and level crossings are lit.
// While Claude waits on the person it draws up as it does when idle, at the
// next red signal or alongside a platform, and stands there, the diesel
// idling: its headlight's beam (by day too), the red signal it waits at and
// the platform's lamps glow up and fade with each slow breath, the whole view
// breathing in sepia (waiting.ts). Answered, the signal clears, the horn
// sounds and it pulls away.
//
// The band is the train side-on from beside the line, the camera keeping
// pace with it: everything else slides past at its depth's pace (the hills
// barely, then a treeline beyond the fields, the fields, the poles in front
// fastest, streaking at speed). The tall spine looks straight down on
// it: the track up the pane, the countryside streaming down past it.
// Painted as pixels (2 × 2 a cell) by PixelScene, which eases the level and
// the night, folds the pixels into glyphs and blanks it all at level 0.
