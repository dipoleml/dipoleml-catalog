// REVISION: flow-v170-dry-scenes
//
// The shared wait: how every scene looks while Claude waits on the person (a
// permission to grant, a question to answer, a plan to approve). The work
// settles (the level drops to a calm 2) and each scene holds its own way: the
// fire banks to glowing coals, the surfer sits up on the board, the skier
// stops, the engine runs down, the balloon hovers, a rocket holds its stage,
// the stars stop streaming. Over the whole frame it turns a warm sepia that
// breathes slowly: a photograph, paused, with a standby light's slow pulse.
// So it reads the same in every scene, by day or night, at any level, and
// nothing like smoke (grey) or a full context's blue. It eases in and out
// over about a second. Pure: no engine imports.
