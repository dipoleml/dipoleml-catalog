# Engram on ZCode

[ZCode](https://z.ai) is the agentic coding client you are reading this in — and its
extension model is Claude Code-compatible by construction: a plugin manifest at
`.zcode-plugin/plugin.json` (or the legacy `.claude-plugin/` one Engram already ships),
native `SKILL.md` directory-bundle skills discovered at user and workspace scope, a
`SessionStart` hook runner, and `AGENTS.md` instruction files. The port adds exactly
the same shape as dsh: one manifest, one format switch inside the existing shared hook
script, `$ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT` first in the engine-resolution waterfall's four loops, and
documentation. No adapter code.

Verified against **ZCode 3.9.2** (macOS, August 2026) — statically against the shipped
runtime's own plugin/skill/hook loading paths, plus the live `engram.py selftest`
(315/315). A live model-driven session is not yet on record: if you run one before we
do — good or bad — an issue report closes that gap for everyone (see the
[user-session protocol](docs/user-sessions/) note in [RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md](RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md)).

## Install

### Route A · plugin marketplace (recommended)

ZCode reads this repository itself as a marketplace (it consumes
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, which ships here for Claude Code; no ZCode-specific
marketplace file is needed):

1. Open **Settings → Plugin Management → Discover**, press **`+`**, and add the source:
   `https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram` (a Git URL or local clone path work too).
2. Select **Engram** and click **Install**.
3. Restart ZCode (or start a new session) so skills re-scan.

That's everything. The install gives you, with zero config:

- **The three skills** — invoked as `/learn`, `/review`, `/coach`. On builds that
  namespace plugin skills, use `/engram:learn` etc.; both spellings resolve to the
  same skill. Requires nothing else — every skill carries its full discipline inline.
- **The nudge.** ZCode loads each installed plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`, and it enables
  the hook runner automatically when a plugin contributes hooks — unlike config-file
  hooks, no `hooks.enabled` flag is needed. Two subtleties shaped the wiring. First:
  ZCode **discards plain SessionStart stdout** (unlike Claude Code, which prints it into
  context), so a hook that prints plain text runs but delivers nothing. Second, ZCode's
  runner also records non-JSON stdout as a *failed* hook run, so "silently ignored" is
  not quiet enough — the log would show engram failing every session where reviews were
  due. The shared `hooks/hooks.json` therefore registers ONE entry whose script
  ([`hooks/session-start.sh`](hooks/session-start.sh)) picks its output format from its
  environment: under ZCode's plugin context `ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set alongside the
  legacy `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and the presence of that variable switches the same
  two-line nudge into the JSON `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` shape ZCode parses.
  Claude Code and Codex see plain stdout exactly as before. One registration cannot emit
  twice on any platform by construction.

Optionally add the tutor rules as ambient instructions so they apply even outside
skill invocations: append an Engram block from any of the skills'
[`_shared/dialogue-grammar.md`](skills/_shared/dialogue-grammar.md) headers to
`~/.zcode/AGENTS.md`. The skills carry everything they need on their own; without it,
nothing degrades.

### Route B · clone + symlink (no plugin system)

Useful when your ZCode build restricts marketplaces, or to track `main` directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram ~/.agents/engram
```

Then link the three skills into either discovery root:

```sh
# ZCode-only installs: point SKILLS at ~/.zcode/skills instead.
SKILLS="$HOME/.agents/skills"
mkdir -p "$SKILLS"
for s in learn review coach; do
  if [ -e "$SKILLS/$s" ] && [ ! -L "$SKILLS/$s" ]; then
    echo "engram: $SKILLS/$s already exists — move it aside first"; continue
  fi
  ln -sfn ~/.agents/engram/skills/$s "$SKILLS/$s"
done
```

(The guard matters: `ln -sfn` into an existing real directory silently nests the link
one level deep, where discovery deliberately does not look — and `learn`/`review`/
`coach` are generic names in a shared namespace. One variable decides the root, so the
guard protects whichever root you pick.)

`~/.agents/skills` is the cross-tool root: the same three links light the skills up in
ZCode *and* the DeepSeek Harness port ([INSTALL-DSH.md](INSTALL-DSH.md)), which clones
into the same home. If you'd rather not share, put the links under `~/.zcode/skills/`.

**The nudge on route B** is optional wiring through the user configuration file
(`~/.zcode/cli/config.json`) — and here the flag is mandatory:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "events": {
      "SessionStart": [
        {
          "matcher": "startup|resume|clear|compact",
          "hooks": [
            {
              "type": "command",
              "command": "ENGRAM_HOOK_FORMAT=json \"/Users/you/.agents/engram/hooks/session-start.sh\""
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Absolute paths — the hook environment does not expand `~`, and there is no plugin-root
variable in this route, but the script self-resolves relative to its own location
anyway. The `ENGRAM_HOOK_FORMAT=json` prefix matters here: this route has no plugin
context, so without it the script would print plain text — which ZCode silently drops.
(`ENGRAM_HOOK_FORMAT` also unlocks the script for any future host that treats SessionStart
stdout as data rather than context.) `enabled: true` is the step people forget: config-file
hooks are disabled by default, so without it the hook runs nowhere and looks like an
engram bug.

## Model / auth

Whatever provider your ZCode session already uses — there is nothing to configure, and
the engine never talks to the network (its AST-scanned no-network guarantee covers the
hook wrapper too). `python3` must be on PATH; stock macOS/Linux Python is fine.

## What's shared, what's different

- **State**: the same `~/.claude/learning/` as every other platform — learn in ZCode,
  review in Claude Code, one schedule. (`ENGRAM_HOME` overrides the location.)
- **Engine resolution**: skills resolve `scripts/engram.py` through their waterfall —
  `$ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT` first (checked before `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, because ZCode sets
  both to the same install root), then the working tree, then `~/.agents/engram` last so
  the clone route shadows nothing.
- **Subagents**: register like everyone else's *conceptually*, constructed like dsh's.
  Engram's agent definitions ship inside the plugin (visible in Settings → Subagents /
  the plugin reference some builds inject), but ZCode treats declared plugin agents as
  diagnostic-only in this build — so the skills do not rely on named types. They spawn
  the blind assessor as a fresh-context `general-purpose` child pointed at the agent
  file, per ["The ZCode shape"](skills/_shared/subagents.md). Freshness comes from the
  Agent tool's process boundary; blindness comes from passing items by file path and
  keeping dialogue out of the prompt. If a child were forked instead, the receipt would
  look valid and be worthless — never accept a graded claim from a grader that saw the
  lesson.
- **Sandbox / permissions**: Engram writes state outside your workspace
  (`~/.claude/learning/`). Under default permission modes, approve that write when the
  harness asks, once per path.

## Verification checklist

```sh
# engine + state sane
python3 ~/.agents/engram/scripts/engram.py doctor      # or your checkout/plugin cache root

# the nudge emits what ZCode parses (empty output = nothing due = correct)
python3 <root>/scripts/engram.py session-start | head -1     # what will ride inside the JSON
<root>/hooks/session-start.sh                                # no vars → plain text (CC behavior)
ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT=<root> <root>/hooks/session-start.sh       # ZCode plugin ctx → {"hookSpecificOutput"...}
```

In-session checks: the skill appears in the `/` menu; after starting a session with
reviews due, the `[engram] N reviews due` line lands near the top of the conversation;
with zero reviews due the hook stays silent (Constitution art. 8).

## Caveats

- Verified against 3.9.2; ZCode ships fast. Drift shows up as a missing surface (nudge
  lost, skill unlisted), not a crash — the port deliberately uses only stock surfaces.
- The format switch rides on `ZCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT` being present in ZCode's plugin hook
  environment. If a future ZCode renames that variable, sessions fall back to plain
  stdout — which that runner discards — so the symptom is a *missing* nudge, and
  `ENGRAM_HOOK_FORMAT=json` is the standing override that restores it on any host.
- A model-driven user session has not been recorded yet (see top). Until one lands,
  treat the learn loop's ZCode behavior as high-confidence-but-unexercised rather than
  proven-on-platform.

## Updating

Plugin route: Settings → Plugin Management refreshes from the marketplace, then reinstall/update Engram there (or ask your agent to pull this repo for the clone route). A stale cached marketplace shows "already current" against an old tree — refresh before you believe it.
