/**
 * Resolve an agent CLI binary (e.g. "claude", "codex") cross-platform.
 *
 * The original resolver shelled out to `which <cli> 2>/dev/null` and fell
 * back to `~/.claude/local/<cli>`. Both are Unix-only: `which` does not exist
 * on Windows (it's `where`), and an extensionless path is not a runnable
 * Windows program. On Windows the wiki-worker's `execFileSync(claudeBin, ...)`
 * therefore always threw ENOENT — caught and swallowed — so the summary file
 * was never written and every memory row stayed an empty placeholder.
 * (Confirmed against an all-placeholder memory table on a Windows user.)
 *
 * Windows specifics:
 *  - `where` prints EVERY match (e.g. `claude`, `claude.cmd`, `claude.ps1`),
 *    one per line. We prefer a directly-spawnable image: `.exe` (no shell
 *    needed) over `.cmd`/`.bat` (shell required — see {@link binNeedsShell}).
 *  - The per-user fallback is `claude.cmd` (the npm-style shim shape).
 *
 * @param cli       the executable name to look up (e.g. "claude", "codex").
 * @param fallback  what to return when the lookup finds nothing. Defaults to
 *                  the claude native-install location `~/.claude/local/<cli>`
 *                  (`.cmd` on Windows). Agents installed elsewhere pass their
 *                  own fallback (typically the literal CLI name, so PATH
 *                  resolution is retried at spawn time).
