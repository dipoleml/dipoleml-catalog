# Stand up (or re-seed) the ClickHouse target for the clickhouse connector.
#
# Unlike the cloud connectors' setup scripts, nothing here provisions cloud
# infrastructure: self-hosted ClickHouse is a container, so this script is both
# the local dogfood stand-up and what the clickhouse job in
# .github/workflows/integration.yml runs. That is deliberate. The Postgres pair
# spells its seeding twice (once here, once as a psql step in the workflow) and
# the two can drift; this connector has exactly one seeding path, so they cannot.
#
# The seed is applied through `clickhouse-client --multiquery` inside the
# container rather than over HTTP, because the HTTP interface refuses
# multi-statement bodies.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup_clickhouse_dev.sh          # start container if needed, (re)seed
#   scripts/setup_clickhouse_dev.sh --down   # remove the container
#
# Idempotent: re-running drops and recreates the app and dbt_dev databases.

# No capabilities at all. Started as root, the image's entrypoint needs CHOWN for
# the directories it creates and SETUID/SETGID for `clickhouse su`; started as
# clickhouse, every directory the image ships is already its own, so nothing has
# to be granted, and `docker exec` (the seeding path below) runs as clickhouse
# too. The server logs that it lacks the optional capabilities it would use for
# memory locking and thread priorities, and runs without them.
#
# Both limits are sized from measurement, not copied from the Postgres script.
# The pids limit counts threads, and ClickHouse starts about 675 of them for its
# background pools before it serves a query, peaking near 700 over the whole
# `-m clickhouse` suite, so 2048 bounds a runaway with room to spare. On memory,
# the server refuses a query once its resident set reaches 90% of the limit; it
# idles at about 0.6 GiB and peaked near 1.9 GiB over the suite, so 1g fails the
# first verified map on a fresh server and 2g leaves almost no headroom.
# scripts/check_container_hardening.sh refuses the container if any of these is
# missing.
