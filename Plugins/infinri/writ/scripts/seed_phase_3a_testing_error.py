"""Phase 3A of the public rulebook expansion: Testing + Error Handling.

Seeds 30 new TEST-* and ERR-* rules into Neo4j (0 mandatory) and renames
2 legacy TEST-* rules:

  TEST-TDD-001 -> TEST-EXIST-001  (every public function has a test)
  TEST-ISO-001 -> TEST-ISOLATE-001 (no cross-test state)

TEST-INT-001 is retained as a Writ-specific integration-test rule (the
public TEST-EDGE-001 covers error-path testing, which is a different
concept). PHP-TRY-001 / PHP-ERR-001 / PHP-ERR-002 are retained as PHP
language extensions of the language-agnostic ERR-* rules.

Idempotent. Re-runs MERGE existing rules with the same rule_id.

Per the public rulebook source: out-of-the-box-rules.md sections 6, 7.
