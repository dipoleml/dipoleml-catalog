"""Rescore existing cross-runtime JSONLs with the latest detector.

The runner captures the full agent response into result_snippet[:300]
and runs detection at write time. When detector regexes are updated,
existing JSONLs become stale: the data is still valid but the
`passed` / `routed` / `ic_result_present` flags reflect the old
detector.

This script reads the captured `result_snippet` (300 chars) plus
re-runs detect_ic_result and detect_portfolio_evidence on it. Note:
result_snippet is truncated, so this is a lower-bound rescore — if a
signal lives past char 300 we'll miss it. For a true rescore we'd
need to re-capture the full text, which means re-running the barrage.
The truncated rescore catches the common case (markers appear early).
